This repo is dynamic.  Feel free to do PRs to update this repo.


## A few resources to get you started:

1. A recent version of Python 3, such as Python 3.9 or better
2. Some Raspberry Pi-s - either physical or virtual
3. WiFi if you have physical RPi-s or a system where you can install virtual machines.
   This WiFi should not have wireless isolation turned on.
