## Many thanks and amplifications!

All of my students and worshop attendees. This support has ranged from thoughtful questions
to deep insights.


Thanks of particular importance are:

1. Gautam Jayakar suggested the title.  Gautam has always been a strong and helpful entrepreneurial spirit.
2. Tandai Gomo's support has made this and other pursuits easier.
3. Himadri Nath Saha's support and thoughtfulness helped a great deal.
